# The Go Programming Language - Book exercises

Repository containing some exercises from the ***"The Go Programming Language"*** book (Alan A.A. Donovan, Brian W. Kernighan).

These exercises are merely for learning purposes and do not, by any means, represent any best practice/clean code; as such, they are not really organized in packages - only in chapters (sometimes!) - as they are meant to be kept as simple as possible in order to provide immediately a single ***main.go*** file to test the assumptions and experiments from the book, meant to be run with ***go run main.go*** command.
Official and best version of such exercises and packages are all available for download at https://gopl.io
